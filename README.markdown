# Correcting My Date Problem

This code is a follow up to a
[post](http://www.rlb3.com/blog/2012/10/20/all-my-old-posts/) I made a
few months ago.

## A Mistake...

On October 20, 2012 I was changing my bloging platform. I was moving
from wordpress to octopress. Don't ask. Anyway, the wordpress blog was
hosted on wordpress.com so I figured I would make a backup and parse
it to make the octopress posts. I wrote a quick script and created all
the posts. What I didn't notice right away was that posts I just
created all had the same date. October 31, 2009. That was the date of
a transfer I did between Moveable Type to wordpress. Don't ask. So now
all my previous blog posts look like they happened on a single day of
unbridled creativity.

Since I realized the mistake I've been meaning to fix this. The problem was
I needed to find the MT database with the original dates in it. After a little
hard drive seraching I found a backup.

And the rest is in the commit history.
